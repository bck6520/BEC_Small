Low-Resource and Fast Binary Edwards Curves Cryptography
by Brian Koziel, Reza Azarderakhsh, and Mehran Mozaffari-Kermani

This contains the Sage scripts that verify the differential addition formulas used over binary Edwards curves.
These scripts were originally made using Sage's online tool.
The incorrect differential addition Sage script was originally proposed by Kim in Binary Edwards Curves Revisited.
The correct differential addition Sage script was found in the source paper and is proven by the Sage script.
